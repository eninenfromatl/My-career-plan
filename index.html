<h2>What do zoologists study?</h2> 

<p>Zoologists are scientists who study animals and their behavior, physiology, genetics, and ecology. They may specialize in studying a particular group of animals, such as birds, mammals, reptiles, or insects, or they may focus on a particular aspect of animal biology, such as animal behavior or the evolution of species1. Zoologists and wildlife biologists study animals, those both in captivity and in the wild, and how they interact with their ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Zoologists traveling.</h2> 

<p>Zoologists may work indoors or travel for fieldwork to remote locations around the world. They may travel to scorching deserts, arctic tundras, or into the deep sea for their research. While travel can be a significant perk, this type of work can also be strenuous and isolating. Zoologists are often exposed to a variety of climates and must be able to travel when necessary for their jobs.</p>
